Question: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


Approach: Try to sell each day and find minimum price before that day ...

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int length = prices.length;
        int minPriceSoFar = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<length;i++){
            minPriceSoFar = Math.min(minPriceSoFar,prices[i]);
            int profit = prices[i]+(~minPriceSoFar+1);
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit,profit);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
